The place to eat itself is very small and rather hot, maybe that is why people rather go with take outs than eating on the spot. The food, though, is still as good as I remember years ago, the brand chain do keep their flavor and taste intact all these years. The kitchen is separated into two section (I guess),  one at the front close to the street and one at the back. They only cook noodles in the front kitchen, beverages and other dishes are made in the other kitchen (and it takes a while for those dishes to be cooked, even for fried rice, maybe because of the numerous take outs they have to handle). Therefore, if you are in a rush, I suggest you to order from their noodles menu or just order for take outs."      }
